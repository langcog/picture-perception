Generally, CDIs are completed in written form, but in developing country settings parents may have insufficient literacy to complete them alone. We designed CDIs to assess language development in children aged 0;8 to 2;4 in two languages used in Coastal communities in Kenya. Measures of vocabulary, gestures, and grammatical constructions were developed using both interviews with parents from varying backgrounds, and vocabulary as well as grammatical constructions from recordings of children's spontaneous speech. The CDIs were then administered in interview format to over 300 families. Reliability and validity ranged from acceptable to excellent, supporting the use of CDIs when direct language testing is impractical, even when children have multiple caregivers and where respondents have low literacy levels.},

	abstract = {The influence of culture on cognitive development is well established for school age and older children. But almost nothing is known about how different parenting and socialization practices in different cultures affect infants' and young children's earliest emerging cognitive and social-cognitive skills. In the current monograph, we report a series of eight studies in which we systematically assessed the social-cognitive skills of 1- to 3-year-old children in three diverse cultural settings. One group of children was from a Western, middle-class cultural setting in rural Canada and the other two groups were from traditional, small-scale cultural settings in rural Peru and India.In a first group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's most basic social-cognitive skills for understanding the intentions and attention of others: imitation, helping, gaze following, and communicative pointing.Children's performance in these tasks was mostly similar across cultural settings. In a second group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's skills in participating in interactive episodes of collaboration and joint attention.Again in these studies the general finding was one of cross-cultural similarity. In a final pair of studies, we assessed 2- to 3-year-old children's skills within two symbolic systems (pretense and pictorial). Here we found that the Canadian children who had much more experience with such symbols showed skills at an earlier age.Our overall conclusion is that young children in all cultural settings get sufficient amounts of the right kinds of social experience to develop their most basic social-cognitive skills for interacting with others and participating in culture at around the same age. In contrast, children's acquisition of more culturally specific skills for use in practices involving artifacts and symbols is more dependent on specific learning experiences.},

Jones and Smith argue that shape is central to the semantic representations of both children and adults (Jones, S.S., Smith, L.B., 1993. The place of perception in children's concepts. Cognitive Development 8, 113-139). In contrast, Soja et al. suggest that children do not rely on shape per se, but rather name representations, which are often indexed by shape (Soja, N.N., Carey, S., Spelke, E.S. 1992. Perception, ontology, and word meaning. Cognition 45, 101-107). Two studies were designed to test the latter hypothesis. Forty-seven children (2 years 5 months-3 years 11 months) and 32 adults participated. Each saw a series of line-drawings roughly shaped like various namable objects (e.g. a man). For half the participants, each line-drawing was described as depicting a shape that was created intentionally (e.g. someone painted a picture). For the remaining participants, each drawing was described as depicting a shape that was created accidentally (e.g. someone spilled some paint). Participants were simply asked to name each picture. We hypothesized that subjects would use shape as the basis of naming primarily when the shapes were intentional (and thus plausibly representations). The findings supported the predictions, for both children and adults. These results suggest that, although shape does play an important role in children's early naming, other factors are also important, including the mental state of the picture's creator (intentional vs. not). Thus, the data suggest that from an early age, children's picture naming incorporates their theory of mind.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of a large number of object concepts and naturalistic object images has been growing strongly in cognitive neuroscience research. Classical databases of object concepts are based mostly on a manually curated set of concepts. Further, databases of naturalistic object images typically consist of single images of objects cropped from their background, or a large number of naturalistic images of varying quality, requiring elaborate manual image curation. Here we provide a set of 1,854 diverse object concepts sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. Using these object concepts, we conducted a large-scale web image search to compile a database of 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of those objects, with 12 or more object images per concept and all images cropped to square size. Using crowdsourcing, we provide higher-level category membership for the 27 most common categories and validate them by relating them to representations in a semantic embedding derived from large text corpora. Finally, by feeding images through a deep convolutional neural network, we demonstrate that they exhibit high selectivity for different object concepts, while at the same time preserving variability of different object images within each concept. Together, the THINGS database provides a rich resource of object concepts and object images and offers a tool for both systematic and large-scale naturalistic research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.},

	abstract = {Direct assessments of executive functions (EFs) are increasingly used in research and clinical settings, with a central assumption that they assess “universal” underlying skills. Their use is spreading globally, raising questions about the cultural appropriateness of assessments devised in Western industrialized countries. We selectively reviewed multidisciplinary evidence and theory to identify sets of cultural preferences that may be at odds with the implicit assumptions of EF assessments. These preferences relate to motivation and compliance; cultural expectations for interpersonal engagement; contextualized vs. academic thinking; cultural notions of speed and time; the willingness to be silly, be incorrect, or do the opposite; and subject-matter familiarity. In each case, we discuss how the cultural preference may be incompatible with the assumptions of assessments, and how future research and practice can address the issue. Many of the cultural preferences discussed differ between interdependent and independent cultures and between schooled and unschooled populations. Adapting testing protocols to these cultural preferences in different contexts will be important for expanding our scientific understanding of EF from the narrow slice of the human population that has participated in the research to date.},

We report 2 studies that support the idea that infants' manual response to pictures is driven by the resemblance of depicted objects to the real objects they represent. In Study 1, we report that infants' manual investigation of pictures is directly related to how realistic they are: The more depicted objects look like real objects, the more manual investigation they evoke. In Study 2, we show that 9-month-old infants' manual behaviors are concentrated on depicted objects even when there are areas of greater perceptual contrast on the page.

Rather, the results from Experiment 1 reflected the child's interpretation of the word as referring to the pictured kind. A third study confirmed that a novelty preference within a perceptually specified category could not account for the results of Experiment 1. A final study (Experiment 4) examined whether 18-month-old infants also understand pictures and words as symbols, and results were comparable to those of Experiments 1 and 2. Taken together, these results confirm that the mapping between words and objects for 18- and 24-month-olds is a referential relation, as opposed to an associative one. Furthermore, these results show that children as young as 18 months begin to understand the symbolic nature of pictures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Infants were recruited from a rural village in Tanzania and had no prior experience with pictures. After a picture book interaction during which a novel depicted object was labeled, we assessed infants’ learning and transfer of the label from pictures to their referents. In a 2nd study, we assessed infants’ learning and generalization of new names using real objects, rather than pictures. Tanzanian infants demonstrated a similar pattern of learning and generalization from real objects, when compared with infants in Western culture. However, there was a significant difference in learning and generalization from pictures to real objects.

	abstract = {Early childhood researchers frequently use learning materials and assessments involving pictures, across different cultures and contexts. However, there is variation in when and how children across cultures and contexts begin to understand and learn from pictures. While children growing up in high-income contexts often have more experience with picture books and other kinds of two-dimensional visual symbols, children growing up in low-income, rural contexts in low- and middle-income countries often have less experience with pictures and other kinds of visual symbols. The current research leverages variation in picture experience within a geographical region to investigate whether previous picture experience is related to toddlers’ (1) performance on a picture-based word learning task, and (2) referential understanding, controlling for maternal education, number of toys, caregiver talk, and caregiver play. One hundred and twenty-eight toddlers in urban and rural western Kenya (n = 64 per area), who had varying amounts of picture experience, participated in a picture-based word learning task. Preregistered analyses with the entire sample showed no relation between picture experience and performance on a picture-based word learning task, or between picture experience and referential understanding. However, exploratory analyses found a positive association between picture experience and performance on the picture-based word learning task in the urban sample, but not the rural sample. We found no association between toddlers’ referential understanding and picture experience, in either sample. We discuss how these results may inform the efficacy of learning materials and the validity of assessments used with children from diverse global backgrounds.},
